  <b>Explainable AI</b> stands for <b>Explainable Artificial Intelligence</b>.<br>
While many might understand or relate "Artificial Intelligence" to <b>Terminator</b> like this:</p>

Artificial Intelligence in actuality however does not directly refer to robotics, machineries, or intelligent bodies like such, but may be more appositely described as algorithms of various forms. </p>

In fact, Artificial Intelligence is a technical term with broad meanings, and includes many varied branches of studies -- with Deep Learning being at one of its cores. It is a function that mimics the workings of human brain neuro activities and is prevalently used in a number of prediction and recognition tasks today. <br><br>
This project therefore aims to make Artificial Intelligence, specifically Deep Learning, more interpretable to the great users -- to allow more trust and understandings into intelligent systems like such.<br><br>
Excitingly, this project forms its basis on <b>Stock Predictions</b> and today, we not only make stock forecasting with machine learning accessible to everybody, but also make these projected outcomes <b>INTERPRETABLE</b>!
