## Welcome to Explainable AI!

**Explainable AI** stands for **Explainable *Artificial Intelligence***.

While many might understand or relate "Artificial Intelligence" to **Terminator** like this:

Artificial Intelligence in actuality however does not directly refer to robots, machineries, or intelligent bodies like such. In fact, Artificial Intelligence is a technical term with broad meanings, and includes many varied branches of studies -- with Deep Learning being at one of its cores.

Deep learning is prevalently used in a number of prediction and recognition tasks nowadays. This project therefore aims to make Artificial Intelligence, specifically Deep Learning, more interpretable to the great users -- to allow more trust and understandings into systems like such.
