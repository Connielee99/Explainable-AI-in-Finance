## Stock Market

<p align="justify">
  The stock market is undoubtedly one of the most unpredictable, yet most popular areas for financial investment. Through facilitating exchanges of securities between buyers and sellers, this marketplace creates opportunities of capital gain for participants ranging from small individuals to big entities such as banks or conglomerates.

Artificial Intelligence in actuality however does not directly refer to robotics, machineries, or intelligent bodies like such, but may be more appositely described as algorithms of various forms. </p>

In fact, Artificial Intelligence is a technical term with broad meanings, and includes many varied branches of studies -- with Deep Learning being at one of its cores. It is a function that mimics the workings of human brain neuro activities and is prevalently used in a number of prediction and recognition tasks today. <br><br>
This project therefore aims to make Artificial Intelligence, specifically Deep Learning, more interpretable to the great users -- to allow more trust and understandings into intelligent systems like such.<br><br>
Excitingly, this project forms its basis on <b>Stock Predictions</b> and today, we not only make stock forecasting with machine learning accessible to everybody, but also make these projected outcomes <b>INTERPRETABLE</b>!</p>
